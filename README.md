# Term Launch

### Small utility tool for easily launching a terminal

Pressing Ctrl+Alt+T will open a terminal.
If a File Explorer is focused while pressing the shortcut,
the terminal will be launched within the opened folder.

### Todo:

-  Config
-  Run as a Service
-  Integrations with other useful programs (VSCode)
-  Fix Win11 File explorer tabs not being fully supported (Only the first openend tab works)
